## About the Video Course
The Spring 5.0 release is by far the most exciting Spring Framework release. Spring 5 brings in support for JetBrains' Kotlin language and the new reactive stack web framework. It helps you build robust, high-performance apps on a low budget.

In this course, you'll learn how to use the Spring 5 framework and unlock its benefits. You'll get started with the features of Spring 5.0 and extend your programming skills to build apps easily. Using the power of beans and dependency injection, you'll learn to wire application components with ease. You'll learn to handle UI-focused tasks better within your application and will then integrate Spring with your database to perform some basic CRUD tasks. We then introduce you to WebFlux, using which you will build a Spring Web App from scratch. Finally, you'll use reactive programming to build an end-to-end application.

By the end of the course, you'll have built a solid foundation in Spring 5 that will enable you to quickly make changes or scale up your apps in line with business needs.
